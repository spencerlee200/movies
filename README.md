# Red Seat Cinema

  Technologies Used: Angular, firebase, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and OMDB API

  For this project I got to work with Angular and firebase for the first time. I definitely underestimated how powerful Angular is as a tool. This site works in a similar way to IMBD allowing users to look up movie information, add their own movies, or even sort movies by rating, name, genre, and several other criteria. You can see it live [here]
